# MarketLens 
### AI-Powered Market Sentiment & Insight Platform

MarketLens is a full-stack market sentiment analysis platform that combines
real-time news sentiment, historical price behavior, and AI-generated insights
to help users understand market emotion rather than predict prices.

Instead of giving financial advice, MarketLens focuses on explaining:
- how the market is behaving,
- what direction sentiment is moving,
- how strong the momentum is,
- and how volatile recent conditions have been.

The system is designed for retail investors and learners who want
clear, explainable market intelligence.

### Core Features

-  **Market Emotion Index (MEI)**
  - A normalized 0–100 sentiment index derived from:
    - weighted news sentiment
    - historical price movement
  - Designed for interpretability, not prediction

-  **Smart News Analysis**
  - Fetches market-relevant headlines
  - Deduplicates similar news using fuzzy matching
  - Filters low-signal headlines
  - Assigns relevance-weighted sentiment scores

-  **Historical Trend Analysis**
  - Tracks MEI over time
  - Computes:
    - sentiment trend (rising / falling / flat)
    - momentum strength
    - volatility level

-  **Alert System**
  - Generates alerts based on:
    - extreme sentiment
    - momentum shifts
    - volatility spikes
  - Displays factors contributing to alerts

-  **AI Market Assistant**
  - Uses contextual market data
  - Explains trends in plain language
  - Explicitly avoids financial advice

-  **Flutter Frontend**
  - Live MEI gauge
  - Trend charts and sparklines
  - News cards with AI follow-up
  - Clean, reactive UI

## Known Issues / Limitations

- MEI history is stored in memory (resets on server restart)
- News availability depends on NewsAPI limits
- AI assistant responses depend on external API availability
- Price-based MEI is sensitive to low-liquidity data
- This project does NOT provide financial advice

## Roadmap
### Planned Improvements

- Persistent database for MEI history
- Multi-stock comparison view
- Sector-level sentiment analysis
- Rate-limit handling and retry logic
- Dark/light theme toggle
